## BME688-ARTYS7-50-SPI-MAIN ##
Drivers, example code and FPGA fabric configuration to utilize the Bosch Sensortec BME688 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas sensor on the AMD Spartan S7 FPGA utilizing the Digilent ARTY S7-50 Devboard. The FPGA fabric was configured in Vivado 2023.2 and the C code for the Microblaze processor was developed in Vitis 2023.2.

### CHANGELOG ##
* v1.0 - Initial semi-functional version. Not 100% operational, a lot of bugs to work out but it does complete the bitstream and will compile and run in Vitis. A lot to get functional, Vivado is not very friendly to beginners.
