## BME688-ARTYS7-50-SPI-MAIN ##
Drivers, example code and FPGA fabric configuration to utilize the Bosch Sensortec BME688 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas sensor on the AMD Spartan S7 FPGA utilizing the Digilent ARTY S7-50 Devboard. The FPGA fabric was configured in Vivado 2023.2 and the C code for the Microblaze processor was developed in Vitis 2023.2.

### CHANGELOG ##
* v1.0 - Initial semi-functional version. Not 100% operational, a lot of bugs to work out but it does complete the bitstream and will compile and run in Vitis. A lot to get functional, Vivado is not very friendly to beginners.
* v1.1 - 4/3/2024 MSD - Managed to get the SPI driver working. The unit will read the chip ID (0x61, 97) and the variant (0x1, 1) ID properly. Since the design is using a QSPI flash chip and the QSPI bus for interfacing with the BME688, it does not want to execute properly from within Vitis. Any changes made in Vitis need to then have the bitstream rewritten and then uploaded to the QSPI flash. Once the system loads from QSPI, all operates as expected. Controlling the CS pin manually as the XSPI driver is very limited. I hope this code example helps others to not get a headache when working with this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM
