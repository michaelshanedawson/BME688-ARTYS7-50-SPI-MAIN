2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer qspi_flash_ss_iobuf/IBUF (in qspi_flash_ss_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_sck_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_sck_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_ss_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_ss_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal BME688_i/mig_7series_0/u_BME688_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the BME688_i/mig_7series_0/u_BME688_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of BME688_i/mig_7series_0/u_BME688_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
